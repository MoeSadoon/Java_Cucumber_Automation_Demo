This is a BDD framework demo automating the basic processes of a mock online shopping site (http://automationpractice.com/)

It uses cucumber to produce user features and generate corresponding step definitions, Selenium to drive the browser and JUnit to make the assertions.

To run this, simply clone this repo, alter the BrowserStart file to point to a webdriver in your directory, and finally run the RunnerTest class.
